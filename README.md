# Neural network using only Python, numpy, and Calculus

The mathematics behind backpropogation were learned in this lecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=13581&v=Ixl3nykKG9M&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fadamdhalla.com%2F&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title&ab_channel=AdamDhalla

All the necessary concepts to understand the mathematics behind backpropogation are summarized in the pdf file, which are notes taken from the lecture.

I also referenced Samson Zhang's video on neural network implementations, in order to create the test cases, which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8yWXqWQYmU&ab_channel=SamsonZhang.
