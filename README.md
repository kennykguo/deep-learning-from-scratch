<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a repository containing deep learning algorithms, with implementations using only PyTorch tensors/NumPy arrays in Python, PyTorch's gradient tracking, and C/C++. This resource contains efficient implementations of these algorithms from scratch, and as reusable modules.

I created this repository to refine my own understanding of deep learning concepts, and also, for teaching purposes.
